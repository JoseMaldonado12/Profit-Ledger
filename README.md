# Ebay-Selling-List
This program is an Ebay selling list. During the summer, I saw a close family member of mine struggling with an
old-school pen and paper style ledger, where they kept all their sales made in Ebay. While Ebay does offer
similar services, it comes at a price. Likewise, Excel also costs a pretty penny, plus it had lots of features
they didn't want to fuss with, so they didn't. Thus, I made this program.
