1. What is this program's purpose?
2. How is the data being stored?
3. Can I personally use this program?

1: Originally, this program was to be used by a close family member of mine for use in their small
Ebay business endeavours. However, now that I have posted this online, this program has been changed to be more general purpose. 
This is now for anyone looking for a simple program to sell items online in Ebay without the need for Excel. 
While it is quiet simple, that is its purpose; if you are simply a person flipping clothes from your local goodwill perhaps as a small side job,
and don't require all of excel's complicated bells and whistles, this programs for you.

2: The bulk of the data is being stored in a QList. In order to save your current database, all one has to do is click "File" then "Save As"
on the top of the window, and then voila-your data is saved. Anytime you wish to go back to an old database, simply click "File" and then "Open"

3: If you wish to use this program for your own personal use, please, be my guest. However, if you want to incorporate *any* changes to the source code,
please contact me at emanueljose11@hotmail.com .
