## Getting Started

Getting started with this program is simple, all you need to do is download either the build or the src folders.
If if you need to download the source folder, then that means you will have to compile the program itself.


If you choose to download the build folder, all you would need to do is run *Ebay_Selling_List.exe* and you can now run the program!
